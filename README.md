Repository generated in support of the manuscript "Decision tree models and cell fate choice" by Ivan A. Croydon Veleslavov and Professor Michael P.H. Stumpf. 

Core functionality is provided by the [CellFateDecisionTrees.jl package](code/CellFateDecisionTrees.jl). We also provide a [Jupyter notebook](code/Notebook_Decision_Trees_For_Cell_Fate_Choice) covering training decision tree models in Julia from single-cell data, assessing their predictive performance on witheld samples, visualising learnt models, designing perturbations for targeted sample reclassification, etc.
