# cell-fate-decision-trees

Repository generated in support of the manuscript "Decision tree models and cell fate choice" by Ivan A. Croydon Veleslavov and Professor Michael P.H. Stumpf. 

Core functionality is provided by the [CellFateDecisionTrees.jl package](code/CellFateDecisionTrees.jl). We also provide a [Jupyter notebook](code/Notebook_Decision_Trees_For_Cell_Fate_Choice) covering training decision tree models in Julia from single-cell data, assessing their predictive performance on witheld samples, visualising learnt models, designing perturbations for targeted sample reclassification, etc.
